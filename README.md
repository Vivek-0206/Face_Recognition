# Face_Recognition
Face Recognition with VGGface 

 1. OpenCV
 2. VGGFace
 3. VGGFace_With_SSD
 
For Generating face use [`Face_Detection`](https://github.com/Vivek2509/Face_Detection) repo.

 1. If you want to use `Face_Alignment` go with haarcascade.
 2. For more `accuracy` and `speed` go with SSD.

You can download `Model` [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UXtRRJLpD5izx54-2K0jnN-Q9cgu_qaa?usp=sharing).
> Note that you can't use this model for `tranfer learning`. For that you can visit [here](https://sefiks.com/2018/08/06/deep-face-recognition-with-keras/)
